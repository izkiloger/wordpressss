== Description ==
Everyone seems to have a blog these days. And Journal Notes gives you a nice and easy entry into the world of blogging.

The theme is super simple to set up. You can just add in your great posts and you’re good to go! There’s really nothing to it.

But there’s even more power to Journal Notes. Tapping into the WordPress site editor, Journal Notes allows you to customize your entire website, from how the site title looks to the colors and fonts used on the site and so much more. Plus there are a variety of different patterns that you can use to change how your posts are displayed as well as crafting your pages.

So whether you want something super simple that you can start with in just minutes or the ability to really make this blog your own, Journal Notes will help you start your blog today!

== Installation ==
- First make sure that the Crosswinds Framework theme is installed on your website (you don't need to activate it).
- From your sites admin, go to Themes > Install Themes.
- In the search box, type 'Journal Notes' and press enter.
- Locate the entry for 'Journal Notes' (there should be only one) and click the 'Install' link.
- When installation is finished, click the 'Activate' link.

= Manual Install =
- Download the file from the theme page.
- Unzip the file.
- Using an FTP client (I recommend FireZilla), upload the 'journal-noates' file to your Wordpress theme folder. Make sure the file you upload simply says 'journal-notes' with no numbers after it. Otherwise, it won't work.
- Go into your Wordpress Admin, navigate to 'Appearance > Themes'.
- Find the Journal Notes listing on this page and click 'Activate'.

== Changelog ==
