== Description ==
The Crosswinds Framework gives you a blank canvas that you can create anything from. Whether you are looking to create an online store, a lead generation website or just want a plain blog, whether you want something that looks fancy, formal, casual or anything in between, you’ll be able to create it with The Crosswinds Framework.

If you want to get started with a design created for you, you can check out one of the many Crosswinds Framework child themes (both free and paid). And if you really want to customize your website with the Crosswinds Framework, you can even create your own child theme to create the website of your dreams.

With the Crosswinds Framework, the possibilities are endless with what you can do with your website.

== Features ==
= Blank Canvas =
The best part about the Crosswinds Framework is that it truly is a blank canvas for you to create. While there are patterns and some styles set up for you so that you have a starting point, it’s not opinionated, and it’s easy to change those initial designs. Want to use serif fonts? Those are preloaded into the theme. Need to change the colors to match your branding? It’s really easy to make those changes. Want to change the header, footer or any of the templates? No problem.
This is your website, and you get to choose what you do with it.

= Block Patterns =
The Crosswinds Framework comes with several different block patterns that allow you to quickly create great pages and posts. From pricing tables to feature blocks to hero sections to headers and footers and more, these patterns can help you craft the perfect page.

= Left/Right/No Sidebar Pages =
Want a sidebar on your posts and pages? Don’t want to have any sidebars? Would you prefer you had a sidebar on the left side? No problem! You can choose any style you like for your blog posts, pages and even archive templates to make this website your own.

= Full Page Layouts =
Want to create a new homepage or landing page in just one click? The Crosswinds Framework comes with a couple of full page layouts that give you a complete page with a click. All you have to do is fill out the text, images and other content.

== Installation ==
Getting started with the Crosswinds Framework is pretty simple. You’ll be up and running with it on your website in just a few minutes after following these instructions.

- Download the theme ZIP file from the releases page on GitHub.
- Upload the theme to your WordPress website through `Appearance -> Themes -> Add New -> Upload Theme`.
